I want to create a roguelite game based on von neuman probes, inspired by the bobiverse series. Also inspired by the game universal paperclips.

The game has to be quick to develop, I'm planning to use an LLM to write code directly to the file system, which limits my options of a game platform.

I'm looking forward to the game taking somewhere between 10-45 minutes to complete, and throws you into an interesting scenario that builds up to completion. The game should be independently fun and focus on a specific kind of problem that a VNP would run into. For example for bobiverse, they run into a planetary evacuation, tooling age species, alien invasion, or hackers.

There should be a tech tree that is unique each time, that unlocks super technologies or scale. It can be against enemies or supporting allies that are superior or inferior, to feel both sides of the coin.

The discovery, research, and exploration is a tech tree. You start with specific technologies and characteristics - can customize the game to allow for specific progressions, and basically play the scenario to completion. To keep out of the 200+ hour 4x game genre, a rogue light will encourage more exploration and micro management rather than constantly falling back to macro.

That said the role of a macro strategist can be done in a micro way, by applying time skips and dilation.

There can also be a story mode of which tech breakthroughs / events are scripted. This idea meshes well with one of my original scripts of no-just-go where you're chasing a time warp device, and as you fail to destroy it, you use it.

Demonstrate variants and multiple scenarios. This can be as simple as harvesting within a system or creating intergalatic supply chains. Assembling fleets of dreadnaughts or scavenging colony vessels and building transports.

I want every minute of the game to have an exciting moment, from low stress to high stress by the end. There should be a feeling of thrill and survival, sheer accomplishment. Perhaps its trying best to survive and onslaught, or it can be trying to attack quickly enough to save a civilization from destruction.

The player's decisions should always be impactful, immediate and long term. It should be clear that their decision makes a difference. The stress occurs, increasingly, that making a wrong decision will have consequences that have even more power and dramatic outcomes, that maybe cannot be reversed

I like the idea in bobiverse where the personalities of the different VNPs diverge. This allows for those which are more compassionate, business, military, stubborn, adventurous, or any kind of result of replicant drift.

I would like some degree of text graphics, can use dwarf fortress design aesthetic. I like Universal paperclips UI a lot, and also mindustry. In terms of 4x I enjoyed eu4, which is very heavy data based.

Here are questions I've received before and how I've answered them:

1. What is the primary verb of the game? Overcome. Overcoming scarcity, abundance, war, peace - pushing boundaries a bit further, seeking freedom and choices.

2. How will the tech tree be presente and interacted with? The player is given decisions to make, pick "A" or "B", or one of N number of options. These will drive probabilities and certainties in development, potentially in a short or long term reward. Users playing a lottery like strategy for some long developments can be different than playing consistent sustainable diverse bets for near term initiatives. The choices should be grounded quantitatively, with roots in economics, physics, and finance.

3. How will you handle time dilation? Time dilation / skips is one specific story scenario, i don't want to dive into it too deeply. Allow the user to modify the speed of the game because a VNP can experience millisecond calculation, real time, and relativistic time scales across eternity. It should be grounded in the real, physical and relative universe. So sending a fleet building craft across light years will experience 'real' time less, so defenders have a time advantage.

4. How will you handle failure? I think failing is part of learning a system - the idea of making the deaths quick is that you should get slightly farther each run. By the time you have comfort with the systems, you can use and expand your tech tree (following 80/20 paradigm, 20% investment rewards 80%, with log growth). A sophisticated player will be using 20% of the capabilities given to them originally with a system, but open different mechanics to be managed, therefore being able to have larger scope. Remaining competitive with 20% will require mastery, but they can be more ambitious and break through more gates in the story.
